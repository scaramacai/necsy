Most of the examples here are distributed with 4nec2, while others can be found on the net. Note that, at this stage, the only test I'm doing is that __necsy__ run without errors and the file it produces can be run by xnec2c.
I have not checked the resulting antennas against 4nec2 or other nec2 implementations.
