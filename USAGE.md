Clone the repository or download the zip archive and unzip it in a directory of your choice.

There is no installer, since there is no need to install. The only requirement is that math_4nec2.py and necsy.py be on the same directory.

You need Python 3 to run the script.

Make __necsy.py__ executable and run:


`necsy.py -i <input_file>` or `necsy.py -h` for help

If this does not work try:
`python3 necsy.py -i <input_file>` or `python3 necsy.py -h` for help
