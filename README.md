# necsy
Python script to transform files using the "SY" card in legacy nec2 files.

This work was inspired by the bash script __necsym__, written by Chris Maple, as well as by the extended use of symbolic calculation included in models used by 4nec2.

My main aim is to have an easy to extend and open source front-end to be used, for example, with xnec2c and nec2c.

At the moment the work is unfinished and there are still unimplemented features. Expect also errors and Python "traceback(s)".

I have also included some examples to test the programs. To my knowledge, files in the examples directory, are freely distributable. Should it not be the case, please contact me.

Suggestions and comments are welcome.
